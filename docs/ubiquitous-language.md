# Ubiquitous Language

This glossary defines canonical terms used across test configuration, template workbooks,
runtime behavior, and reporting.

## Canonical Terms

| Canonical term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| sender | The identity used to correlate a sent test email with an actual result event. |
| subject | The subject value used to disambiguate candidate matches for the same sender. |
| event schema | The AVSC or JSON Schema that defines event field structure for projection, matching, and validation. |
| test case | One executable validation row in the test template, including metadata, input, and expected values. |
| enabled test case | A test case marked for execution (`Enabled = TRUE`). |
| expected event | A normalized expected event derived from a workbook row, including expected field values. |
| actual event | A normalized event derived from Kafka payload data for matching and validation. |
| match result | The validation outcome for a matched expected/actual event pair. |
| mismatch | A field-level difference between expected and actual values for a matched pair. |
| conflict | An ambiguous match where one actual event has multiple candidate expected events. |
| unmatched expected event | An enabled expected event with no resolved matching actual event. |
| unmatched actual event | An actual event that cannot be matched to any expected event. |
| send status | Delivery state for a test case email attempt (`SENT`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`). |
| run metadata | Run-level context and counters written to the `RunInfo` sheet. |
| attachment mode | The interpretation mode of `ATTACHMENT` content in a test case. |
| file-path mode | Attachment mode where each non-empty line is resolved as a filesystem path. |
| text-to-pdf mode | Attachment mode where cell text is rendered into one generated PDF attachment. |
| matching field path | An event-schema-flattened field path used to extract sender/subject for matching. |
| test configuration | The YAML/JSON file passed via `--config` that defines event schema, matching, SMTP, mail, and Kafka settings for a run. |
| test template | The generated `TestCases` workbook used to define test case metadata, inputs, and expected values. |
| test configuration template | A placeholder YAML scaffold generated by `generate-config` to bootstrap a test configuration. |
| project initialization | The `init` command flow that prepares `.venv`, installs `uv` into it, and syncs dependency groups. |

## Boundary Mapping

| Boundary | External name | Canonical term |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workbook input | `FROM` | sender |
| Workbook input | `SUBJECT` | subject |
| Test configuration | `matching.from_field` | sender matching field path |
| Test configuration | `matching.subject_field` | subject matching field path |
| Kafka payload | configured event schema path value | actual sender / actual subject |

## Notes

- Canonical terms are used in domain-facing APIs.
- External labels remain unchanged at adapters and IO boundaries.
